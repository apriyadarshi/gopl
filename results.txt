 	Title:	Journal
 	URL:	
 	Transcript:	[[Man picks up book from a table]]
Man: Since when do you keep a journal?
[[Man in black hat leans over from computer to answer]]
Man in black hat: Oh, I pretend to write in it on the train, and wait for a shy-looking girl to sit across from me.
[[Scene change to a train. The man in black hat is sitting across from a girl]]
Main in black hat (narrating): I glance up and wait for her to make eye contact, then look down bashfully and, if I can, blush.
[[Scene back to original room with man and man in black hat]]
Man in black hat: Then, when I see her start to smile at me, I roll my eyes and hit her with a quick glare, then resume writing.  The alienation stays with her all day.  It's great.
[[Man in black hat is back to typing on the computer]]
Man: You're sickening.  This is why we can't have nice people
Man in black hat: I can't help it. It's like shooting lonely, angsty fish in a barrel.
{{title text: And the journal is filled with all the things I'd say to her if I were nice like you.  I burn it when it's full.}}

 	Transcript:	[[Two people are gathered around a computer. A person is seated interacting with the computer while another stands behind them with an arm resting on the back of the chair.]]
Person 1 (seated): What hidden arrow?
Person 2 (standing): I thought everyone knew about it. Pull up the FedEx logo.
<<Click>>

[[The second person is now pointing at the screen.]]
Person 1: Where is it?
Person 2: Right there. Look at the whitespace.
Person 1: I don't see it.

[[The next panel shows a stylised view of the FedEx logo. The white space above the 'ed' in Fed is decorated to look like a tank turret with the barrel extending into the letter 'F'. Along the bottom of the letters a baseball player with the number 24 on his back is reaching out to catch a baseball. The baseball is forming the centre of the 'e' while the arm provides the break for the tail. The baseballers head marks the centre of the 'd' and the number 24 is coloured in blue to show the lower half of the stroke of the 'd'. Toward the right of the image the space between the 'E' and 'x' has been decorated to look like a Guy Fawkes mask, with ties wrapping around the 'x' and being drawn off-screen. A faint outline suggests the whitespace above the 'x' is a hat, with the brim extending into the upper part of the 'E'. Two speech bubbles are visible above the drawing, both spoken by off-screen characters.]]
Person 1 (off-screen): All I see if Guy Fawkes watching Willie Mays catch a fly ball while an armored assault vehicle rolls past.
Person 2 (off-screen): ...You either need more medication or less. Not sure which.
